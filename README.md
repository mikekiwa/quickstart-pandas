# quickstart-pandas
A notebook to get you started usings Pandas to analyze and plot a small sample data set using Jupyter notebooks.

## Requisites
Python 3.x with all the required libraries. These include [Pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas), [Numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy), [Matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib) and [Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook). <p>
It is strongly recommended by [Jupyter's documentation](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) to use the [Anaconda distribution of Python](https://www.anaconda.com/download/).

Previous knowledge of Python is recommended. 

## Getting started
1. You can view the notebook within Github [here](https://github.com/cnlee1702/quickstart-pandas/blob/master/Pandas%20Tutorial.ipynb).

2. Fork a copy to your own repository and clone directly to the environment you installed Python and Jupyter.

3. Within your own environment, launch Jupyter either through command line or through Anaconda Navigator. Further documentation for running Jupyter for your particular environment can be found [here](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/running.html).

4. Find the repository's directory and open the _Pandas Tutoiral.ipynb_ notebook.

5. You can follow along by reading and can execute the code yourself.

6. Explore importing new data sets or discovering new functions for the libraries by visiting their documentation (links within the notebook)

## Acknoledgements
The sample data set was generously donated by [_Brian McEntire_](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-mcentire/). The data set is from various weather measurements around his home.
